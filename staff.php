		<h3>Habitat for Humanity</h3>
		<p>
			I have been involved in several Habitat for Humanity projects both in Maine, in Alabamaâ€™s Black Belt and the Mississippi Delta. I have served on the local board for years where we are focused on building sound housing with a sustainable model. Our current focus includes the development of four - 600 square foot houses in Rockland, Maine on the site of former housing for millworkers.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.midcoasthabitat.org">www.midcoasthabitat.org</a>
