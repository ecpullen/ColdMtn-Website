	<h1>
		Craftsmanship, Culture and Collaboration
	</h1>
	<p>

		Founded in 1976 and based in Belfast, Maine, we are builders, first and foremost, who seek uniquely challenging projects to which we apply both sound traditional building methods and a well-informed practice of sustainable technology.<br /><br />
		<img src="images/aboutus.jpg">
		We are known throughout the Maine community for our high standards, problem-solving ability and attention to detail in the field. Our corps of field leadership is deeply experienced and dedicated to a strong and steadfast collaboration between owners, design groups and our own team of first-quality craftsmen and subcontractors.<br /><br />We take great pride in our highly experienced administrative team and its ability to plan, organize and manage the results of each project against established schedules and budgets.<br /><br />Our workshop in Belfast continues its long history of producing fine woodworking components for our projects, including millwork, casework and fixtures.
