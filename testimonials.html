				It was both a pleasure and privilege to partner with Cold Mountain Builders in the construction of a significant custom residential project on the Maine coast. In the course of my architectural practice, I would rate my experience with Cold Mountain Builders as the best and most professional I’ve experienced.<br /><br />From top to bottom, Cold Mountain Builders is predicated on a tightly organized, highly efficient methodology with attention to detail being its hallmark. Above all, it is the people who work for and with Cold Mountain that make the difference.<br /><br />I found the carpentry crew members not only highly skilled craftsmen, but thoughtful, educated men working in a convivial, non-smoking environment without blaring music. Perhaps the most telling characteristic lies in the attitude of the foreman. It’s never an attitude of it can’t be done, but rather one of what we can do to make it happen. I knew I was in good hands and working with people who would do everything in their power to help me and my client achieve our vision.<br /><br />This attitude carried over to Cold Mountain’s stable of subcontractors as well; associations honed over many years and based on a mutual understanding of trust and some of the highest quality work I’ve seen.<br /><br />The attitude of confidence, integrity, and cooperation that Cold Mountain Builders brings to a construction site in combination with the high standards set for both themselves and those working with them, make them an excellent choice for any building project. I am pleased to offer them my hardiest recommendation.

				Jay Fischer was the key to our project’s success. He was the first person we talked to about the suitability of the site, which was tight and steep, before we even started looking for an architect. Jay’s knowledge of construction and design, his common sense and his ability to anticipate problems and find solutions—and his ability to communicate—ensured that the house embodied our dream and the process of building it was a pleasure. The house is small, with complicated rooflines and intricate finishes, and thanks to Cold Mountain Builders’ high standards, it is as elegant and sturdy as a wooden boat. Jay solved every detail, from engineering a narrow spiral stairway to something as small as figuring out a way to fit a screen door under a low overhang. The house is beautiful, and it sits on the land as if it has always been there. It was completed over ten years ago, and as the house settled one or two things eventually needed some fixing; the same crew that worked on it came and made the repairs. Jay works for the long term; he builds houses, and he also builds relationships.

				I have worked with Cold Mountain Builders on projects since at least 1978, when we collaborated on the Republican Journal building in Belfast. I am always greatly relieved when a project includes Cold Mountain, because I can be sure that the work will be done to highest standards and the many decisions that are made on site, especially during a renovation project, will be made with intelligence and care—and that major decisions affecting the outcome of the design will be referred to me.<br /><br />A project goes well when the stakeholders are included, and Cold Mountain is outstanding for its careful process of consultation and collaboration. They choose excellent subcontractors and collaborators, and the project is a joy to be involved in.<br /><br />Much, though by no means all, of our work together has been on alterations to existing buildings, and it is here that careful attention to the quality of the decision making is especially critical. I have served as the Architect member of the Maine State Historic Preservation Commission, and I have been deeply involved in preservation projects both in my own practice and in my duties in the Commission. As such I have a great appreciation for people who understand the special concerns of working carefully with historic buildings.<br /><br />We recently completed a complex preservation project restoring a water powered mill in Freedom, Maine. This required assembling a team of specialists in many fields, from hydraulic engineering to heavy timber framing to historic roofing materials. The project had to meet stringent preservation requirements to qualify for the Maine Rehabilitation Tax Credit, and it had to satisfy the environmental concerns of dealing with a dam on a small river. Cold Mountain was charged with the overall coordination of the project as well as the reconstruction and repurposing of the buildings. The project ran smoothly and communication was always good, and the results have received a state preservation award. It was a privilege and pleasure to be part of that team effort.

				We interviewed more than a dozen Maine architects, explaining what was then no more than a concept for development of the land we had purchased. One architect commented, “This might be a project for Cold Mountain.” Then a second did.<br /><br />Architect hired. One who knew of, but had never worked with, CMB. We met Jay Fischer for dinner in Portland. It changed our lives.<br /><br />In my experience, the best projects represent collaboration—between client, architect, landscape designer, contractor and interior designer. It is a team effort in which every member of the team plays an essential role.<br /><br />Over the course of more than two years, we developed the highest possible regard for CMB, its crew and subcontractors. It is a firm characterized by intelligence, integrity, craft, and good taste. Every member of the crew and its supervisors and management share a commitment to excellence which mirrored ours. We knew it wasn’t ordinary and would not come cheaply. It is among the best investments we ever made. More than a decade later, our house remains a source of pride and gratification.

				From the months of preplanning with our architectural team before ground had even been broken, to the extraordinary finished project, Cold Mountain Builders have provided the highest level of professional skill. Each individual impressed us as highly competent and serious about their work. Rick Tyler, our project manager, led the team in the most expert and conscientious manner, which indeed is equally reflected in the guidance of Jay Fischer and his staff at the top of the company. It is a company that has been so successful and a dream to work with because of superb leadership from every part of the organization, the extremely high quality of workmanship and attention to detail. We had no worries throughout the whole process and will always choose to work with them in the future. Cold Mountain Builders is a company of integrity and heart and it has been a privilege to work with them.

				In many years of architecture practice, I’ve had the good fortune to work with several talented building contractors, but it’s difficult to think of any others that can match the talent and expertise offered by Cold Mountain Builders.<br /><br />From the beginning of a new project with Cold Mountain, it’s clear that this is no ordinary building contractor, and this will be no ordinary journey. Jay Fischer leads a subtle team-building process that integrates the client, architect and builder, forming a bond of shared aspirations that continue through the project. He is that rare combination of confident and open: one trusts his ability to solve problems and achieve goals, but his confidence never strays into a set way of doing things, instead always focused on the particular parameters and needs of the project.<br /><br />The Cold Mountain team has a genuine curiosity about design and architecture. The entire crew seems to quickly understand the design narrative of the project almost as well as the architect. A site visit is an unusually stimulating event, where conversations range from budget and schedule (meticulously managed), to the aesthetic resolution of a challenging joint between two surfaces, or even on to the history of an unusual material specified for siding.<br /><br />Cold Mountain’s long history in the area also means that they have a substantial knowledge base of local craftspeople, materials, and suppliers to ensure their projects will feel at home in Maine. Be prepared: on the trail of a perfect cache of beautifully weathered stone, one must expect road trips with Jay Fischer to obscure unnamed locations, but it will be a memorable adventure. Jay understands: a house is a collection of stories, and he’s there to help tell the first ones.

				Cold Mountain Builders stands out because of its high level of both craftsmanship and professionalism. The craftsmanship I have observed includes the great hands and understanding of materials found in their superior carpenters.<br /><br />Jay Fischer’s education, exposure and experience with detail and finishes allow him to really understand what architects and sophisticated clients are thinking about.<br /><br />On the professional side, Cold Mountain Builders workmen relate equally well to owners, subcontractors, and designers. It is also the way that they resolve problems in the field. Jay sets the tone for this.
